## THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY IN ALPHA. IF YOU ENCOUNTER ANY ERRORS/BUGS, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND REPORTING IT UNDER [ISSUES](https://github.com/nwoof2012/Nwoofs-Wynn-Shader/issues), ESPECIALLY IF NO ONE ELSE HAS YET.
Are you looking to play Wynncraft with shaders, but don't want to compromise on playability or visuals? _**Nwoof's Wynn Shader**_ is designed with a goal to fulfill that wish at its core. Designed and written based on problems encountered by Wynncraft players regarding shaders, this is the first shader designed with the Wynncraft player's experience in mind.
